**Abstract**
In this article we describe a new approach for detecting changes in rapidly evolving large-scale graphs.
The key notion involved is local alertness: nodes monitor change within their neighborhoods at each
time step. Here we propose a Ô¨Ånancial local alertness application for cointegrated stock pairs.
