**Abstract**
WalkRNN, the approach described herein, leverages research in learning continuous representations
for nodes in networks, layers in features captured in property grah attributes and labels, and uses
Deep Learning language modeling via Recurrent Neural Networks to read the grammar of an enriched
property graph. We then demonstrate translating this learned graph literacy into actionable knowledge
through graph classificaiton tasks.
