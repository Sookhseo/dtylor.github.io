Our prior site was quietly terminated by the host, and as a quick replacement, this site was built using github pages and is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). 
Thanks to this [guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) , the process has been relatively easy.  
Please stay posted for blog posts, hopefully surrounding the subject of my work in graph analytics, Spark, deep learning and other data science topics.
